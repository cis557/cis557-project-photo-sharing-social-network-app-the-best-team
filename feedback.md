| Project and tasks                                   | Good                                              |  
|                                                     |                                                   |
| Wiki                                                |                                                   |
|   Design                                            | Excellent                                         |
|                                                     |                                                   |
|   Resources                                         | Good                                              |     
|                                                     |                                                   |
|   Interface                                         | Excellent. Do not forget to update your interface |
|                                                     | as you move to higher levels.                     |
|                                                     |                                                   |
|   API                                               | Good. Do not include implementation information   |
|                                                     | like scope in your table. Include the attributes  |
|                                                     |   of your resources.                              |
|                                                     |                                                   |
|   Issues                                            | Good use of issues. You should create more labels |
|                                                     | It will help you in linking them to user stories  |
|                                                     | and also to differentiate testing from            |
|                                                     | implementation. Assign each issue to a member     |
|                                                     |                                                   |
| Continuous Integration                              | Great! I am assuming you are working on fixing    |
|                                                     | the failing test.                                 |
|                                                     |                                                   |
| Workflow                                            | Keep your master branch clean and develop new     |
|                                                     | features and tests in separate branches. Make     |
|                                                     | sure to merge regularly. Create a new branch for  |
|                                                     | each issue and merge when it is completed         |
